Welcome to the Enchanted Land where fun has no age limit! This display font captures the magic of classic story book telling with princesses and castles. It features a clean glyph set with many
European accents and diacritics. The whimsical style of the caps flow with consistency and shows up in the numbers and many other marks as well.  All caps are NOT recommended. Use
Enchanted Land for a children's project, book title, or anywhere you'd like a little magic. OTF features like kerning, ordinals, fractions, ligatures, alternates, proportional numbers,
and punctuation are all included in the full version. The demo contains basic latin, numbers, and offers some kerning. 

The complete version is available by $25 donation or purchase of a commercial license. Use the donation link on our homepage and tell us which font you'd like in the notes. Please visit
