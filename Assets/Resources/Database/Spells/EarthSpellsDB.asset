    DisplayName: Stun
    Description: Slaps a monster with magical force, forcing it to recover from the
      stun spell before it can do anything else.  Stun also knocks monsters back
      a little, giving you a chance to get away while the getting is good.  The greater
      your skill in Earth Magic, the greater the effect of the spell.

  - ID: magic_arrow
    Number: 1
    SPCost: 2
    DisplayName: Magic Arrow
    Description: Creates and fires a single magical arrow.  Unlike most spells, this
      spell is inaccurate and has the same chance of hitting as a regular arrow (using
      your Earth Magic skill as a bonus to hit).  Also unlike most spells, Magic
      Arrow is free to cast when you become a Master of Earth.  The arrow does 3-8
      points of damage.
    MasteryDescriptions:
    - Casting cost 2 spell points
    - Casting cost 1spell point.  Quicker recovery rate
    - Casting cost 0 spell points.  Quickest recovery rate

  - ID: protect_magic
    Number: 2
    SPCost: 3
    DisplayName: Protection from Magic
    Description: "Increases all your characters\u2019 resistance to magic by an amount
      equal to your skill in Earth Magic. This spell lasts for one hour per point
      of skill in Earth Magic."
    MasteryDescriptions:
    - 1 point resistance per point of skill
    - 2 points resistance per point of skill
    - 3 points resistance per point of skill

  - ID: deadly_swarm
    Number: 3
    SPCost: 4
    DisplayName: Deadly Swarm
    Description: Summons a swarm of biting, stinging insects to bedevil a single
      target.  The swarm only does 5 points of damage plus 1-3 per point of skill
      in Earth Magic, but it never misses and the damage is physical, making resistance
      to this spell unlikely.
    MasteryDescriptions:
    - Moderate recovery rate
    - Faster recovery rate
    - Fastest recovery rate
