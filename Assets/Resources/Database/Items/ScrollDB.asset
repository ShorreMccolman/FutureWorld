    Description: "My Dear Sulman,\n\nYou have done well, and I hereby promote you
      to High Priest of the Second Circle.  There is a sum of gold waiting for you
      in the hands of Andover Potbello in New Sorpigal that he will turn over to you
      if you tell him the Sandman sent you and show him the Seal on this letter.  Sandman\u2026I
      like that.\n\nThe handling of the Roland affair was masterful, and I especially
      liked the snowstorm touch\u2014it really put the Fear in him, didn\u2019t it?
      \ Superstitious fool!  His removal has moved our timetable ahead by at least
      two years and has spared us the trouble of assassinating him at a more delicate
      time.  All arrangements are in place.\n\nMy minions have engineered the recall
      of Queen Catherine to her homeland in Erathia to attend the funeral of her father.
      \ She will not return this year, and that only leaves her worthless brat Nicolai
      and that idiot Regent Wilbur Humphrey running things at the palace.\n\nThe people
      have begun to sense that something is wrong, that perhaps the gods are angry.
      \ That perhaps\u2026the Ironfists have lost the Mandate of Heaven.  Just a few
      more disasters and there may well be a full-scale rebellion!\n\nAnd we will
      be waiting at the breach, ready to step in and tell the sheep what to do and
      when to do it.  Already our temples spread across the land, offering aid to
      those displaced by disasters, and comfort to the bereaved...\n\nYes.  Remain
      in New Sorpigal and stay out of sight.  When the time is right you will be contacted
      and given further instructions.  So take heart, and know that our plan proceeds
      smoothly and we will be ruling this world soon.  Your position in our hierarchy
      will be very high!\n\n      --Zenofex"
