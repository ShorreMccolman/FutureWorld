        FirstDialog: Members of the Shadow Guild have moved down south recently,
          and have been trying to exert their influence over merchants in the area.
          I refused them access to our town, so they kidnapped Sharry Canegie, an
          old healer loved by the townspeople, in an attempt to 'convince' me to
          let them operate here. I can't believe that their extortion has moved so
          far south, I thought I was safe from that down here. Please rescue Sharry-
          I can offer you some money as a reward, and I'm sure the townsfolk would
          appreciate her return.

      Steps:
      - Display: Goblinwatch
        FirstDialog: Just south of town is an old keep called Goblinwatch. It was
          originally built to help keep the town safe from goblin raids, but times
          have been so peaceful recently that we haven't been taking care of it.
          You can imagine our embarrassment when we realized that the very monsters
          we were guarding against have moved into the keep! They also changed the
          lock on a very important door leading to the caves below the dungeon level.
          We have a standing reward of 2000 gold pieces to the ones who can figure
          out the combination and tell us what it is.
