      - Display: Liches
        FirstDialog: Some sorcerers have cheated death itself in their attempts to
          gain power. These sorcerers trade their lives for eternal life as an undead.
          I can't imagine the lust for power that would cause someone to trade their
          soul. Liches are powerful and determined; you should be careful fighting
          them.

      Steps:
      - Display: Cobra Eggs
        FirstDialog: I am a collector of rare and exotic creatures, and I make a
          living by selling some of these creatures as pets. Currently, cobras are
          in great demand, and I don't have many cobras left to sell. Therefore,
          I'm willing to pay handsomely for any cobra eggs you might have. Remember,
          if you find any cobra eggs, I'll give you the best prices.
