      - Display: Quest
        FirstDialog: Could you do the Temple of Baa a favor? It appears that my brethren
          left the old temple to the northwest of here in a little too much of a
          hurry, and a candelabra necessary for some of our rituals was left behind.
          None of the Baa priests want to go back because they're afraid of whatever
          curse has been placed on the temple. If you were to bring back the candelabra
          to me, however, I could reward you in their place.

        NoRequiredItemDialog: Did the curse frighten you away as well? I can understand.
          Baa is patient, however. Should you work up the courage to find the candelabra,
          I'm still prepared to compensate you for it.

          Rule, the roads are almost unsafe to travel anymore. Brigands and bandits
          of all sorts now prey on anyone travelling too far from the protection
          of the castles.
