        FirstDialog: Our town is periodically plagued by giant spider. I'm pretty
          sure that if the spider queen were killed, the rest of the spiders would
          go away. Currently, I'm offering a reward to the person that can kill the
          spider queen.

          of the Elements. The cost to join is 100 gold pieces. Only members may
          purchase spells from our fine library. The guild has spells from all four
          of the elemental disciplines, and like all guilds in the kingdom, we have
          two guild halls. Membership in one automatically enrolls you in the other.
