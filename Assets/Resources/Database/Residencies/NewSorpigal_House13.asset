        FirstDialog: Because skills get so difficult to learn once you've achieved
          a high level in them, it is much more efficient to learn many skills to
          a moderate level, rather than a couple of skills to a high level.

          The lucky and skillful can sometimes avoid damage altogether. I can teach
          you to recognize and avoid these traps provided you've already practiced
          a little (Rank 4) and have 500 gold for my fee.
