  Info:
  - Tag: Knight
    Title: Knight
    Body: The Knight class is the workhorse fighting class.  Knights start with the
      largest selection of weapons and armor, and may ultimately use any type of
      weapon or armor.  Being the toughest warriors of the classes, Knights begin
      with the greatest number of hit points and get the most number of hit points
      when they advance in level.  Knights can be promoted to Cavalier status with
      a two hit point per level gain, and then to Champion status with another two
      hit point per level gain.  Knights may never learn spells, nor may they ever
      learn (or need) the Meditation skill.
  - Tag: Paladin
    Title: Paladin
    Body: "A cross between Knight and Cleric, Paladins perform both roles well, but
      not as well as the more focused classes they borrow from.  Like Knights, Paladins
      can learn to use any type of weapon or armor, although they don\u2019t have
      as many choices to begin with.  Paladins also begin with the Spirit realm of
      magic, and can also learn to use the Clerical Mind and Body realms.  They cannot,
      however, learn to use the greater realms of Light and Dark, nor any of the
      Elemental realms.  Paladins that are true to their cause may be promoted to
      Crusader (gaining one hit point and spell point per level) and ultimately to
      Hero (gaining another hit point and spell point per level).  Paladins may learn
      all of the secondary skills."
  - Tag: Archer
    Title: Archer
    Body: Like Paladins, the Archer is a hybrid of the Knight and Sorcerer classes. 
      Archers may learn to use any type of weapon (specializing in the bow, of course)
      but they may never learn the shield or plate armor skills.  They are compensated
      by beginning with the Air realm of magic and may eventually learn to use the
      rest of the Elemental realms.  The greater realms of Light and Dark are, however,
      beyond their grasp.  Archers can be promoted to Battle Mage (gaining one hit
      point and one spell point per level) and eventually may become Warrior Mages
      (gaining another hit point and spell point per level).  All of the secondary
      skills are open to the Archer.
  - Tag: Druid
    Title: Druid
    Body: Druids are a hybrid of the Sorcerer and Cleric classes.  They make poor
      fighters (better only than the lowly Sorcerer) and have relatively few hit
      points.  On the plus side, Druids can use both Sorcerer and Clerical magic. 
      Druids may not learn Light and Dark magic, and they can only use the staff,
      dagger, and bow as weapons while wearing only leather and shield as armor. 
      All secondary skills are open to the Druid, and as an added bonus Druids may
      begin the game with the Learning skill.  Druids can be promoted to Great Druid
      (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level) and eventually to Arch
      Druid (gaining another spell point and hit point per level).
  - Tag: Cleric
    Title: Cleric
    Body: Clerics in Enroth are adventuring, spell casting holy men.  A Cleric is
      a mediocre fighter but an excellent spell caster, with spells concentrating
      on healing and defensive themes.  Clerics and Sorcerers are the only two classes
      that can learn from the Mirrored Path of the Light and the Dark, and the awesome
      spells these realms of magic offer.  They are, unfortunately, rather limited
      in their weapons, with mace, staff, and bow being their only choices.  Armor
      is a little better with plate being the only kind forbidden them, and they
      have no restrictions on secondary skills.  With much diligence and study, Clerics
      can be promoted to Priest (gaining one hit point and spell point per level)
      and eventually to High Priest (gaining another hit point and spell point).
  - Tag: Sorcerer
    Title: Sorcerer
    Body: Students of the realm of Elemental magic, Sorcerers concentrate on offensive
      and utilitarian magic.  Sorcerers are downright rotten fighters barely able
      to learn to use the dagger, the staff, and the bow effectively.  They are forbidden
      any kind of armor or shield and have the lowest hit points of all the classes. 
      With that aside, Sorcerers can wield mighty offensive spells and have access
      to the Mirrored Path of the Light and the Dark, from which come the best spells
      in the lands.  After plenty of spell casting experience, Sorcerers can be promoted
      to Wizard (gaining one hit point and one spell point per level) and then to
      Arch Mage (gaining another hit point and spell point).  No secondary skills
      are forbidden Sorcerers.
