    Info:
    - Header: Goblinwatch
      Body: I've heard that the abandoned keep on the hill is now home to a pack
        of goblins.  The keep was built to keep the goblins away, so how could this
        possibly happen?
    - Header: Baa Temple
      Body: A day's travel west of here is a new Temple dedicated to Baa.  I've heard
        that bad things happen to rich people that travel near there.
    - Header: Bandits
      Body: The passes through the hills to the west are filled with bandits, travelling
        on foot through there can be dangerous.
