    Info:
    - Header: Goblinwatch
      Body: I've heard that the abandoned keep on the hill is now home to a pack
        of goblins.  The keep was built to keep the goblins away, so how could this
        possibly happen?
    - Header: Baa Temple
      Body: A day's travel west of here is a new Temple dedicated to Baa.  I've heard
        that bad things happen to rich people that travel near there.
    - Header: Bandits
      Body: The passes through the hills to the west are filled with bandits, travelling
        on foot through there can be dangerous.
    - Header: Sea Travel
      Body: Ocean travel around here can be dangerous because of the sea serpents
        and water elementals that roam the oceans.
    - Header: Oracle
      Body: The High Council in Free Haven should really consult the Oracle to find
        out why the Ironfists have lost the Mandate of Heaven.
    - Header: Prince Nicolai
      Body: "Prince Nicolai isn't even in charge anymore\u2013 Regent Humphrey makes
        all of the decisions.  It's not fair to blame Nicolai for all the problems."
    - Header: Solstices
      Body: The two solstices are days of considerable magical importance.  The summer
        solstice is on June 21st, and the winter solstice is on December 21st.
    - Header: Arena
      Body: The stables at Castle Ironfist can take you to the Arena, an ancient
        place where warriors can test their prowess.
    - Header: Goblins
      Body: Goblins are weak creatures, but they tend to attack in large numbers.
    - Header: Apprentice Mages
      Body: Though their physical attacks are weak, these mages can cast various
        elemental attack spells.
    - Header: Mordred
      Body: A powerful artifact, Mordred is a dagger that possesses the ability to
        steal the health of its victim and transfer that vitality to its wielder.
    - Header: Wizards
      Body: Albert Newton in Mist handles the promotion of Sorcerers to Wizards.
    - Header: Abandoned Temple
      Body: The abandoned temple northwest of town used to be occupied by the Temple
        of Baa, but they moved out in a hurry one day last year.  Now there's nothing
        but snakes, bats, and huge spiders.
    - Header: Temple of Baa
      Body: "When the Temple of Baa moved out of that old temple outside of town,
        all of the little problems we've been having just\u2026went away.  I tell
        you, there's something unwholesome about those people.  I'm glad they're
        gone."
    - Header: Curses
      Body: A wizard friend of mine told me the Temple of Baa was laying curses on
        our town from the abandoned temple just outside town.  One day they tried
        to lay the Curse of Endless Vermin on us, only they did something wrong and
        it backfired, infesting their own temple instead.  They moved righty-o quick
        once that happened.
    - Header: Treasure
      Body: I heard the Temple of Baa abandoned that old temple so quickly they didn't
        have time to take all their stuff.  It should all still be down there, if
        you're brave enough to go look for it.  There's a lot of nasty monsters in
        the way, though, so be careful if you go.
    - Header: Goblinwatch
      Body: It's been quite a while since New Sorpigal was raided by goblins, but
        with goblins living in the very place meant to protect us from them, it can't
        be too long before we're attacked again, can it?
    - Header: Magicians
      Body: An evil guild of mages has been searching the southeast end of our peninsula
        for signs of the fabled Fountain of Magic.  They attack anyone who comes
        near to scare off potential rivals.  Be very careful if you travel in that
        direction!
    - Header: Town Fountains
      Body: The three fountains we have here in town are said to draw their water
        from a spring touched by the gods.  Each one is magical and beneficial to
        drink from.
    - Header: Goblin Raiders
      Body: "A raiding party of goblins has staked out the west bridge, hoping to
        rob and kill travelers.  They aren't very subtle\u2013 you can see them from
        a mile away\u2013 but they ARE dangerous.  Watch your step!"
    - Header: New Sorpigal
      Body: Our town was founded centuries ago as the last major town in Enroth. 
        We have historically been a point from which colony ships left for the rest
        of the world.
    - Header: Fruit Trees
      Body: The fruit on the trees in the orchards of our fair town is quite tasty,
        and free for all to take.  You should try it sometime!
    - Header: Islands
      Body: Beware of travelling to the islands just off our north shore.  The waters
        sometime have dangerous monsters, and the islands are none too hospitable,
        either.
    - Header: Regnan Pirates
      Body: It's been decades since we were last attacked by pirates from the islands
        of Regna, and I guess it's about time for us to be attacked again, what with
        the king missing and all.
    - Header: Buccaneers' Lair
      Body: Buccaneers' Lair in New Sorpigal and Mist can teach you dagger, merchant,
        identify, perception, and disarm trap.
    - Header: Protection Services
      Body: You can learn dagger, merchant, identify, perception, and disarm trap
        at protection services in Silver Cove and White Cap.
    - Header: Smugglers' Guild
      Body: Blackshire and Free Haven are homes to the Smugglers' Guild, where you
        can learn dagger, merchant, identify, perception, and disarm trap.
    - Header: Blades' End
      Body: Sword, axe, spear, staff, and leather are all taught in Blades' End in
        both White Cap and New Sorpigal.

        plate, and repair item.
