# FutureWorld
Main repo for FW project

**Welcome to Future World!**
This is a "remake" of one of my favorite games - Might & Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven. This started as a for-fun exercise in remaking the Inventory system of the game but as I expanded it outwards I decided to challenge myself to recreate the starting area of the game in most of its entirety. Along the way I decided to make a number of changes to the controls and UI of the game but for the most part I have tried to keep the recreation faithful when possible. My plan is to recreate the town of New Sorpigal and its surrounding area along with most of the gameplay features of M&M VI. My hope is that this might generate some interest with others who might wish to collaborate on an original game in the same style.

The vast majority of assets in the game were created by me using various tools with a few exceptions. The buildings and terrain were created by my brother. The 3D characters were either made by me with MakeHuman or downloaded from Mixamo.com. The animations in game are currently all taken from that same site. The sounds are from a library I purchased a liscense for. The music is taken directly from the original game and is being used as a placeholder. There are some more 3rd party models and textures but for the most part the artwork was created by me based on designs from the original game.

All of the code with very minor exceptions was written by me. I did not copy any of the original games scripts, everything has been recreated from scratch as my own interpretation however I did study the mechanics of the game very closely and had discussions with community members about the details of a few of the hidden systems. The project is certainly a work in progess, but many systems are already in place.

**Create your Party**

Customize your party members. Portrait, name, class, stats and skills. Each character starts with 4 skills, 2 are determined by class and 2 are of your choosing. Become a member of one of the guilds in town and you can train new skills for a price. You also get 50 points to spend on stats - you dont have to spend them evenly so you can stack a single character if you really want to. Your skills will determine the items each character starts the game with. Choose quick start if you dont care and just want to play.
